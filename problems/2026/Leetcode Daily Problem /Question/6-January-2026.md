# 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree

## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree:

- The **root** is at level `1`
- Its children are at level `2`
- And so on...

Return the **smallest level `x`** such that the **sum of all node values at level `x` is maximum**.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input:  root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
```
**Explanation:**  
- Level 1 sum = `1`  
- Level 2 sum = `7 + 0 = 7`  
- Level 3 sum = `7 + (-8) = -1`  

The maximum sum occurs at **level 2**.

### Example 2
```
Input:  root = [989,null,10250,98693,-89388,null,null,null,-32127]
Output: 2
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`
