## Problem

### Combining tables with SQL

Ok - lets use the concept.

Write a query which does the following

- Join the tables 'student' and 'course'
- Uses 'Course_id' to match both the tables and output the joined table
- Output all entries from the joined table

Expected output

St_id	St_Name	Department	Course_id	Course_id	Course_Name	Credits	Prof_id
1001	John Smith	Computer Science	CS101	CS101	Introduction to Computer Science	3	2001
1002	Emily Brown	History	HIS102	HIS102	World History II	3	2004
1003	David Lee	Mathematics	MAT202	MAT202	Linear Algebra	2	2002
1004	Sarah Johnson	English	ENG201	ENG201	Advanced Writing	4	2003
1005	Michael Chen	Biology	BIO103	BIO103	Principles of Biology	4	2005
